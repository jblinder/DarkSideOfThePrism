A **Firefox Add-on** that provides a soundtrack for our surveilled internet meanderings.

"Dark Side of the Prism" uses Pink Floyd's aural prism (Dark Side of the Moon) as a playlist to the NSA's tracking efforts, serving as an auditory reminder of how our online activities are surveilled.

#Installing
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to Tools -> Add-ons
3. Click the Settings icon
4. Select Install Add-on from file...
5. Choose darksideoftheprism_midi.xpi or darksideoftheprism_live.xpi in the add-ons folder.

#Use
When visiting any URLs that have been (publicly) targeted by Prism, a small notification will appear alerting that this site is being surveilled. You will then be presented with an ethereal Pink Floyd track from the "Dark Side of the Moon" album. 

To mute/unmute the music, press the widget button at the bottom right hand corner of the browser.

#Versions
There are two versions, a Midi and Live version. The Live version plays samples from songs and loops them after about a minute.

#Notes
- The Pink Floyd tracks come from http://www.floydhead.com/MIDI.htm

- There is no Google Chrome extension. Instead, listen to the entire "Dark Side of the Moon" album on reapeat while you surf the internet.
