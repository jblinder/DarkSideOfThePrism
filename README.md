A **Firefox Add-on** that provides a soundtrack for our surveilled internet meanderings.

"Dark Side of the Prism" uses Pink Floyd's aural prism (Dark Side of the Moon) as a playlist to the NSA's tracking efforts, serving as an auditory reminder of how our online activities are surveilled.

#Installing
Double click on the darksideoftheprism.xpi file and it should install on your Firefox browser. 

#Use
When visiting any URLs that have been (publicly) targeted by Prism, a small notification will appear alerting that this site is being surveilled. You will then be presented with an ethereal Pink Floyd track from the "Dark Side of the Moon" album.

#Notes
- The Pink Floyd tracks come from http://www.floydhead.com/MIDI.htm

- There is no Google Chrome extension. Instead, listen to the entire "Dark Side of the Moon" album on reapeat while you surf the internet.
